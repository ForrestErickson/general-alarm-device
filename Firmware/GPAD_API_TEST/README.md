# GPAD API TEST 1

## Summary
This is folder contains files to test the GPAD_API through the serial port using a terminal program.
Example, the text file, GPAD_API_TEST_1.txt is sent by RealTerm to the device under test, DUT.


## Test Files
File names and descriptions.
* GPAD_API_TEST_1.CRLF.txt  This file has CR and LF end terminations.
* GPAD_API_TEST_2.CRLF.txt Similar to GPAD_API_TEST_1 but with messages added. This file has CR and LF end terminations.
* GPAD_API_TEST_2LFOnly.LF.txt Similar to GPAD_API_TEST_1 but with messages added. This file has LF end terminations.
* GPAD_API_TEST_3LF_Only.LF.txt This file has help command and only Alarms with messages and only LF end terminations.
* GPAD_API_TEST_ALPHANUM1.LF.txt This file has upper case, lower case and numeric test characters `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+.[]{}\|;:'",<.>/?
* GPAD_API_TEST_LONGLINE.LF.txt This file has very long line of alphanumeric text.

## Cases of Using RealTerm and XVII32
RealTerm is set up for a 4000 mSecond end of line delay.
RealTerm is set up for to repeat endlessly by setting the number of repeats to zero.  

**Note:** in the RealTerm, Port setup tab you must select with the Open button and press Change button after changes. Using RealTerm on a DUT will conflict with the Arduino IDE on the same DUT. To program with the Arduino IDE, you must un Open the port and press Change to release the port for the Arduino IDE.

Lee used the very helpful program **XVI32** to review and edit the files with the desired line terminations.
